# MoonScript Site

This is what builds <http://moonscript.org>, including the [reference
manual](http://moonscript.org/reference) and the [online
compiler](http://moonscript.org/compiler).

The entire page is built using [Sitegen](https://github.com/leafo/sitegen), a
static site generator written in MoonScript.

The build also depends on [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and
[scssphp](https://github.com/leafo/scssphp).
